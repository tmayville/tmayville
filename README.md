# Hi, I'm Tim — @tmayville

Systems Engineer • Automation Architect • PowerShell SME

I design and ship pragmatic automation for Identity & Collaboration:
- **Microsoft 365 / Entra ID**: account lifecycle, policy & license orchestration
- **Google Workspace**: admin access & calendar/conferencing integrations
- **Messaging & Rooms**: mailbox hygiene, forwarding/rules cleanup, conference room reporting/builders
- **Ops Excellence**: SOP-first development, compliance-ready workflows, clear docs

⚙️ What I build
- Production PowerShell functions & scheduled jobs (API-backed)
- Cross-platform automations with auditable logs and idempotent retries
- Utilities that turn “manual, error-prone” into “repeatable and boring”

📚 How I work
- Document → Automate → Measure → Iterate
- Ship small, reliable increments with guardrails and rollbacks
- Treat customers and teammates like partners; mentor openly
